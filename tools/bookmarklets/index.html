    <h2>What are bookmarklets</h2>
    <p>Bookmarklets are snippets of JavaScript code that can be used to execute code in the context of the current web
        page.</p>
    <h2>How to install</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Select the entire content of the bookmarklet code (including the "javascript:" line).</li>
        <li>Create a new bookmark in your browser (ideally in the bookmark bar, but it works from anywhere in the
            browser bookmarks).</li>
        <li>Edit the bookmarklet and make sure that it is completely empty.</li>
        <li>Paste the bookmarklet code into the bookmark and save it.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How to use</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to the page that you want the code to run on.</li>
        <li>Select or click on the bookmarklet.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Table of bookmarklets</h2>

            <td><p>Viewing an HTML file in a GitHub repository.</p></td>
            <td><p>Redirects user to the same HTML document as it should exist in GitHub Pages. If the page results in an
                error, GitHub Pages may not be set up or there may be an issue with the deployment on GitHub.com.</p></td>

                email notification from Canvas (that might be something like "Click here to review the submission").</p>

            <td><a href="grading-assistant.js">grading-assistant.js</a></td>
            <td><p>Viewing any web page (especially one of the project pages for WDD 130).</p></td>
            <td>
                <p>Creates a block on information at the top of the page. The information includes colors, fonts, links,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>NOTE:<br>While this bookmarklet tries to ensure that it always displays consistently, some CSS, HTML,
                    JavaScript, etc. that is part of a page can cause it to have some issues. In particular, floating
                    headers can overlap the block. To work around these kinds of issues, set the header (or other piece
                    of HTML) to be hidden ("visibility: none;") using the inpsect tool or do other tweaks as needed.</p>
