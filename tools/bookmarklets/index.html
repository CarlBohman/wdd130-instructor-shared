        <li>Create a new bookmark in your browser (ideally in the bookmark bar, but it works from anywhere in the
            browser bookmarks).</li>
        <li>Edit the bookmarklet and make sure that it is completely empty.</li>
        <li>Paste the bookmarklet code into the bookmark and save it.</li>
